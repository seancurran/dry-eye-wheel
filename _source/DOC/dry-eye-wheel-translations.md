## DRY EYE WHEEL

| English | Chinese |
| ------- | ------- |
| DRY EYE WHEEL | 干眼症轮状图 |
| THE WHEEL | 轮 |
| Dry eye is a chronic condition that will require you to work with your patient to manage it. The wheel symbolizes the process of mitigating, measuring, and using that information to inform your management approach. When your patient returns for review, you will gather the information again to understand what or how it has changed and how this may inform further mitigation, measurement and refine your management approach. | 干眼症是一种慢性疾病，需要您与患者共同管理。这个轮状图代表通过缓解措施、测量方式并利用这些信息优化管理方案的过程。当患者前来复诊时，您需要再次收集相关信息，了解其病情变化情况，并据此进一步调整缓解措施和测量方式，以优化您的管理方案。 |
| THE RINGS | 环 |
| The rings shown in the dry eye wheel symbolise the simplest through to more complex approaches for mitigation, measurement, and management of dry eye, according to severity.<br><br>There is plenty you can do to ease the discomfort of dry eye patients through mitigation, measurement, and management, even with no additional investment (bronze outer ring) or limited investment (silver middle ring). As the majority of patients with dry eye have mild to moderate disease, all practitioners need to get involved, referring to specialist centres when needed. | 干眼症轮状图中的各个环代表从最简单到更为复杂的缓解措施、测量方式和管理方案，适用于不同严重程度的干眼症。<br><br>即便没有额外的投入（古铜色外环）或只有有限的投入（银色中环），您也可以通过缓解措施、测量方式和管理方案来减轻干眼症患者的不适。鉴于大多数干眼症患者属于轻度至中度，所有医疗从业者都应参与其中，并在必要时将患者转诊至专科中心。 |

## MITIGATION

| English | Chinese |
| ------- | ------- |
| MITIGATION | 缓解 |
| Triaging with a targeted history and symptoms, as well as conducting a differential diagnosis can allow prophylactic measures to be put in place to limit ocular surface damage<br><br>Other ocular surface conditions can serve as a trigger for the vicious circle of dry eye disease and lead to discomfort symptoms for patients. Reduce this risk by carefully identifying risk factors such as contact lens wear, digital device use, environmental challenges, and hormonal and medicine changes, as well as assessing the eyes for incidental findings, and manage or refer the patient accordingly. | 通过针对性地病史询问和症状分析进行分诊，并开展鉴别诊断，能够采取预防措施来有效遏制眼表损伤。<br><br>其他眼表疾病可能会引发干眼症的恶性循环，导致患者出现不适症状。应仔细识别风险因素（如配戴隐形眼镜、使用电子设备、环境因素、激素变化和药物变更）并同步检查眼部偶发病变帮助降低此类风险，最后根据情况对患者进行管理或转诊。 |
| RISK FACTORS | 风险因素 |
| SLEEP | 睡眠 |
| Poor sleep quality and quantity are associated with an increased risk of dry eye disease, especially less than 5 hours sleep per night. Encourage good sleeping habits to help reduce the risk of dry eye symptoms. | 睡眠质量差和睡眠时长不足（尤其是每晚睡眠时长低于5小时）与干眼症患病风险显著相关。建议养成良好的睡眠习惯，可有效预防干眼症发生。 |
| CONTACT LENS | 隐形眼镜 |
| Contact lenses can disrupt the tear film and risk causing friction with the ocular surface and so should be carefully optimized, especially in those with pre-existing ocular surface disease. | 隐形眼镜可能会破坏泪膜，并存在与眼表产生摩擦的风险，因此应当谨慎调整戴镜方案，对于那些已患有眼表疾病的患者来说更是如此。 |
| EYE STRAIN | 眼疲劳 |
| Digital screen viewing can exacerbate ocular surface disease, especially more than 4-5 hours a day. The impact can be reduced by taking regular breaks, blink exercises, and positioning screens lower than the eyes. | 观看电子屏幕会加重眼表疾病，尤其是每天观看时长超过4-5个小时。可以通过定期休息、进行眨眼练习以及将屏幕放置在低于眼睛的位置来减轻这种影响。 |
| ENVIRONMENT | 环境 |
| Environmental conditions such as air-conditioning and windy conditions can contribute to dry eye; a review of when the dry eye symptoms are worst can allow for targeting the necessary adaptations. | 空调环境和多风天气等外部因素可能会导致干眼症；因此了解干眼症状最严重的时段有助于针对性地采取必要的应对措施。 |
| HORMONS | 激素 |
| Hormones regulate many key physiological body processes, so changes can disrupt the precisely balanced tear film. When hormones are changing, a medical review might be warranted. | 激素对许多关键的身体生理过程有调节作用，因此激素水平的变化会破坏泪膜的精确平衡。当激素发生变化时，可能需要进行医学检查。 |
| MEDICATION REVIEW | 药物审查 |
| Many medications, whether prescribed or over-the-counter, can affect the tear film, so a medication review, in conjunction with the prescribing clinician, might allow for symptoms to be reduced. | 无论是处方药还是非处方药，大多数药物都可能会影响泪膜。因此，与开具处方的临床医生一起进行药物审查，可能有助于减轻相关症状。 |
| TRIAGING | 分诊 |
| HISTORY & SYMPTOMS | 病史和症状 |
| History-taking: Careful history-taking allows identification of dry eye symptoms as well as risks associated with the development of dry eye disease. Modifiable risk factors are especially important to identify, as simple changes in lifestyle can help reduce or eliminate their impact, and promote a healthier ocular surface. | 病史采集：详细的问诊流程有助于识别干眼症状以及与干眼症进展相关的风险。鉴于改善一些生活小习惯可以显著降低甚至消除可干预因素的影响，进而促进眼表健康，因此识别这些风险因素尤为重要。 |
| DIFFERENTIAL | 鉴别 |
| Dry eye disease is just one of many ocular surface diseases. Differential diagnosis helps ensure there aren't other underlying conditions, such as ocular allergy or infection, responsible for the patient's presenting symptoms. Treat co-morbid conditions before tackling any residual dry eye disease, to increase the chances of successful outcomes for patients. The TFOS DEWS II triaging checklist quickly and easily helps narrow down the diagnosis and avoid unnecessary clinical visits. | 干眼症只是众多眼表疾病中的一种。鉴别诊断有助于确保患者症状不是由其他潜在疾病（如眼部过敏或感染）引起。应优先处理合并症，然后再处理干眼症，这样能够提高患者获得良好治疗效果的几率。推荐采用TFOS DEWS II分诊检查表，它能快速实现初筛，并避免不必要的临床就诊。 |
| • How severe is the eye discomfort?<br>• Do you have any mouth dryness or swollen glands?<br>• How long have your symptoms lasted and was there any triggering event?<br>• Is your vision affected and does it clear on blinking?<br>• Are the symptoms or any redness much worse in one eye than the other?<br>• Do the eyes itch, appear swollen or crusty, or have they given off any discharge?<br>• Do you wear contact lenses?<br>• Have you been diagnosed with any general health conditions (including recent respiratory infections) or are you taking any medications?<br>+ Detailed anterior eye examination differential diagnosis where indicated by answers. | • 眼部不适有多严重？<br>• 是否伴有口干或腺体肿胀？<br>• 您的症状持续了多长时间？是否有特定诱因？<br>• 您的视力是否受到影响？能否通过眨眼使视力恢复？<br>• 两只眼睛的症状或发红情况是否相当？<br>• 您的眼睛是否出现瘙痒、肿胀、结痂的情况，或者是否有分泌物流出？<br>• 您是否配戴隐形眼镜？<br>• 您是否已被诊断出任何全身性疾病（包括近期的呼吸道感染），或者是否正在服用任何药物？<br>+ 根据回答情况，进行详细的眼前节检查及鉴别诊断。 |
| PROPHYLAXIS | 预防 |
| Prophylaxis, such as good hydration, controlling environmental conditions, and ocular hygiene, can help prevent ocular surface damage and resulting dry eye symptoms. | 采取预防措施，如保持充足的水分摄入、控制环境条件以及注意眼部卫生等，能够有效预防眼表损伤以及由此产生的干眼症状。 |

## MANAGEMENT

| English | Chinese |
| ------- | ------- |
| MANAGEMENT | 管理 |
| Management of dry eye requires a staged approach, with more severe conditions often requiring multiple treatments.<br><br>However, the majority of patients can be managed with relatively simple strategies, comprising ocular lubricants and lid hygiene measures.<br><br>Management strategies should be ideally aimed at managing the severity of the disease, in addition to being targeted towards the major underlying reason for the dry eye. Sub-typing of the disease into whether it is aqueous-deficient, evaporative, or mixed in nature, can assist with the choice of treatment. | 干眼症的管理需要分阶段进行，病情较为严重的患者往往需要多种治疗手段。<br><br>然而，大多数患者可以通过相对简单的策略来进行管理，包括使用眼部润滑剂和采取睑缘清洁措施。<br><br>理想的管理策略不仅应针对干眼症的主要潜在病因，还应着眼于控制病情的严重程度。将干眼症细分为泪液缺乏型、蒸发过强型或混合型，有助于选择合适的治疗方法。 |
| MILD | 轻度 |
| ARTIFICIAL TEARS | 人工泪液 |
| Ocular lubricants remain a mainstay of dry eye disease management. Many different formulations exist, including lipid-based drops to help stabilize the tear film and many preservative-free options, which are advisable for more severe forms of the disease. | 眼部润滑剂仍然是干眼症治疗的主要手段。目前有许多不同的配方，包括有助于稳定泪膜的脂质类滴眼液，以及多种不含防腐剂的产品，这些产品适用于病情更为严重的干眼症患者。 |
| ADVICE | 建议 |
| It is important to discuss with patients that dry eye disease requires a long-term, ongoing commitment to management and is rarely cured, but rather is managed using a variety of approaches, with careful follow-up with their practitioner being important. | 与患者沟通时务必要使其知晓以下几点：干眼症需要长期、持续地进行治疗，很少能被彻底治愈，而是要采用多种方法来进行管理，认真配合医生的随访也十分重要。 |
| BLINK EXERCISES | 眨眼练习 |
| Reduced blinking during digital device use can result in dry eyes. Training patients how to blink fully, to take regular breaks from near work and to use various methods to remind them to blink regularly can alleviate these issues. | 在使用数字设备时眨眼次数减少可导致干眼症。可以通过以下方式缓解这些问题：训练患者如何充分眨眼，在近距离工作时定时休息，并使用各种方法提醒他们定期眨眼。 |
| DIET AND DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS | 饮食与膳食补充剂 |
| A healthy, particularly Mediterranean, diet can aid the ocular surface along with supplements such as those rich in Omega-3. | 健康的饮食（尤其是地中海饮食）搭配富含欧米伽-3等成分的膳食补充剂，有助于保护眼表。 |
| WARM COMPRESS | 热敷 |
| Heat can be applied externally to the eyelids with the aid of a wide range of warm compresses, which may contain microwave-heated seeds or glass beads, or by latent moist heat application delivered via goggles. Heat helps to unblock the meibomian glands and plays an important role in the management of meibomian gland dysfunction, which is the major factor leading to evaporative dry eye. | 可以通过多种热敷方法对眼睑进行外部热敷，例如使用微波加热的种子或玻璃珠制成的热敷包，或者也可以通过专用护目镜进行持续湿热敷。热敷有助于疏通睑板腺，在治疗睑板腺功能障碍（导致蒸发过强型干眼症的主要因素）中发挥着重要作用。 |
| LID HYGIENE | 睑缘清洁 |
| Eyelid cleansing products can effectively remove lid debris and other irritants from around the eyes and reduce bacteria. Lid hygiene is a mainstay of blepharitis management with some containing active ingredients for the control of demodex specifically. | 眼睑清洁产品可以有效清除眼睑周围的碎屑和其他刺激物，并减少细菌滋生。睑缘清洁是睑缘炎治疗的主要措施之一，某些产品还含有专门用于控制蠕形螨的活性成分。 |
| MODERATE | 中度 |
